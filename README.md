# TTT4280
Lab work for TTT4280: Sensors and Instrumentation, at NTNU.

** Information about measurements: **

__All measurements are found in /resultater/results.txt__

Measurements 1 through 6, as well as 12, are measured using transmittance.\
All of these measurements are completed using PiCam v2 at Fs = 40 Frames/s.

Measurements 7 through 11 are reflectance measurements.\
These are conducted using the phone camera (Samsung Galaxy S10+) and flashlight, at Fs = 1/30 Frames/s.
The exception is measurement 11, which is measured using PiCam v2.

We've mixed in various tests:

Measurement 1 and 2 are done in a dark room void of all external lights.
Measurement 11 attempts to measure the pulse in the forehead by using reflectance.
Measurement 12 is a measurement of a slightly higher pulse after a couple of trips up/down the stairs.
